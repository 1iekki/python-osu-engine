# rythm-game-project
 This is a project where I try to recreate the rythm game Osu! using python with pygame library.
 The rythm_game.py script is the main executable file, the game should be run by running this file.
 You can import any valid osu map, however only osu standard gamemode is implemented.
 Importing maps is made automatically on game start, or can be done manually by calling the loader.py script with the name of a beatmap as argv.
 The settings are stored in the settings.pkl file in ./bin folder, they can be changed by changing values in the hashmap of settings.py and running the script (I did not have time to implement settings screen :c ).
 This project was made as a final project for one of my univeristy classes.
 Use this however you want :D
